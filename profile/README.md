# Bonjour ðŸ‘‹

Polygon specialises in the development of data collection and analysis tools tailored to the specific needs of science research, with a particular focus on improving participant experience.

We are currently building two platforms:

 - The **population survey platform** offers tools that simplify the data
   collection process. Our platform is designed for multiple types of
   studies, and integrates various features such as geospatial data
   capture, network analysis, and momentary tracking.
   
 - The **systems thinking platform** is designed to explore the collective understanding
   of a group of actors regarding a given issue. It draws on two proven
   methods used to tackle this type of problem: [Concept Mapping
   (CM*)](https://www.polygon.company/tools-en/concept-mapping) and
   [Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
   (FCM*)](https://www.polygon.company/tools-en/fuzzy-cognitive-maps).

You can learn about upcoming Polygon features in our roadmap (Notion)

## Repositories

  

We will eventually open-source code we've developed at Polygon for data processing and analysis, as repositories on our Github page, as well as easy, ready-to-use libraries and packages on NPM and PyPI. Keep an eye on our roadmap for upcoming releases.
